# Horse Racing Simulation

This project simulates a three-horse race, where each horse runs in its own lane for a given distance.

## About

This Horse Racing Simulation project provides a Java implementation of a virtual horse race. It includes classes to represent individual horses, manage the race, and simulate the race progress.

### Horse Class

The `Horse` class represents individual horses participating in the race. Each horse has attributes such as name, symbol, distance traveled, and confidence rating. Horses can move forward, fall, and reset their position.

### Race Class

The `Race` class orchestrates the horse racing competition. It manages the race length, assigns horses to lanes, starts the race, and determines the winner. The race progress is displayed on the terminal, showing the position of each horse in its lane as the race progresses.
